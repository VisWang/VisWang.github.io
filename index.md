## About Me
I am a tenure-track assistant professor (ZJU 100-Young professor) at the Department of Sports Science, College of Education, Zhejiang University.
I worked as a postdoctoral researcher (supervised by [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/)) for one year at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I received my Ph.D. (supervised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/)) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University. Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University.

I major in **computational sports science** which mainly focuses on knowledge discovery and visual analytics of sports data. I'm looking for strongly motivated Ph.D. students who are interested in advanced technology in sports science.

Moreover, I am also an amateur photographer. If you want to have a look at the pictures I took, you can visit my [500px](https://500px.com/343725635)
