## About Me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
I received my Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, where I am supervised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/). Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University.

I major in computational sports science which mainly focuses on knowledge discovery and visual analytics of sports data.

Moreover, I am also an amateur photographer. If you want to have a look at the pictures I took, you can visit my [500px](https://500px.com/343725635)
